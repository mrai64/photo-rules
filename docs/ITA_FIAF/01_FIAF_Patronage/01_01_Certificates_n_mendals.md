# 1.1. Certificates and medals

The FIAF Medal Shipping Service, in support of the National Secretariat,
upon receiving notification of the granting from the Competitions Department,
sends the Diplomas to the organizing association and confirms to the
National Secretariat any Medals acquired during the Patronage or
Recommendation request phase, once it has verified that the relevant
fee for the granting of the Patronage or Recommendation and
for the acquisition of the Medals has been paid.
